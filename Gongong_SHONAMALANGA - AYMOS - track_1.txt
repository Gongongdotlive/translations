SHONAMALANGA EP

TRACK 1 -  Shonamalanga - The sun sets

Everything can disappear
but with love I don't agree, No
The sun sets
But my love will always be like this

FIRST VERSE X2

Even if it's painful, dark or uphill
Even if it's fun, bright or downhill
The sun sets
But my love will always be like this

SECOND VERSE X2

Everything can disappear
but with love I don't agree, No
The sun sets
But my love will always be like this

Even if it's painful, dark or uphill
Even if it's fun, light or downhill
The sun sets
But my love will always be like this
