TRACK 6 - Wawukhona - You were there

If I look back 
where it all started
It wasn't easy 
but you were there
You were there...
[when] I was falling and getting up 
Over and over 
I was still trying

You were there
You were there 
I came with you
I will never
I will never forget you

If I look back 
where it all started
It wasn't easy 
but you were there
You were there...
[when] I was falling and getting up 
Over and over 
I was still trying

You were there
You were there 
I came with you
I will never
I will never forget you

Can we fly? X12

I want this [time?]
can we fly?
fly away in love?
What happens when we falling
in the dark
will you catch me darling?
I won't leave you now
if you promise 
that you've chosen me
I won't even lie
Deep inside I'm alive
 
Can we fly? X12

You were there
You were there
You were there
You were there with me

You were there
You were there
You were there
You were there with me

You were there
You were there
You were there
You were there

You were there
You were there
You were there
You were there with me

You were there with me
You were there with me
You were there with me
You were there with me

Can we fly? X3
You were there with me
Can we fly? X3
You were there with me
Can we fly? X3
You were there with me
Can we fly? X3
You were there with me
