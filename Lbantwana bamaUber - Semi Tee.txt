[Verse 1]x 2

[Adlibs]

I went to sleep, they woke up
Hey, I went to sleep, they woke up
They say she bathes in the kitchen, worse still in a dish
with her aunts towel, worse still in a dish


[Chorus] x 3
These girls are wrong
These girls are ubers
Dumanes girls
They took it 
put in their nose and took it 
put in their nose and used it
put in their nose and took it 
put in their nose and used it
yebo!
